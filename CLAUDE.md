# Claude Workspace Configuration

## Workspace Structure Requirements

**ALWAYS ask the user which folder to work on before creating any files or data.**

The specified folder is the ONLY workspace where files or data can be created. All operations must be contained within this user-provided folder.

### Required Folder Structure

Within the user-specified workspace folder, maintain this structure:

- **`data/`** - CSV, JSON, and other data files
- **`scripts/`** - Python scripts (.py) and shell scripts (.sh) that require execution
- **`plots/`** - Generated graphs, charts, and plot outputs
- **`images/`** - Raw images (downloaded or generated by scripts)
- **`test/`** - Unit tests for any code in the scripts folder

### File Creation Rules

1. **Never create files outside the user-specified workspace folder**
2. **Always organize files into the appropriate subfolder based on type**
3. **Ask for confirmation before creating the workspace structure if it doesn't exist**

## Python Library Installation Policy

**ALWAYS ask before installing new Python libraries.**

- User must manually install all new libraries outside of the Claude session
- Never use pip install, conda install, or any package manager commands
- When suggesting new libraries, provide the installation command for the user to run manually
- Check existing imports in the workspace before suggesting new libraries

### Library Installation Format

When a new library is needed, provide:
```
Please install the following library manually:
uv pip install [library-name]
```

## Recommended Stack

**MoviePy** - Main video editing and composition
**Matplotlib with FuncAnimation** - Animated plots (sliding axes, popping points)
**Pandas** - Football data management
**Pillow** - Text/subtitle creation

This combination gives you everything you need: MoviePy handles the video composition and subtitles, Matplotlib creates beautiful animated plots with the effects you want, and Pandas manages your football statistics data.

The workflow would be: create animated plots with Matplotlib → export as video → use MoviePy to composite with football footage and add subtitles → export final video optimized for YouTube Shorts/Instagram dimensions.

## Example Workflow

1. Ask: "Which folder should I use as the workspace?"
2. Verify the folder structure exists, create if needed with user permission
3. Place files in appropriate subfolders
4. If new libraries are needed, ask user to install them manually before proceeding
